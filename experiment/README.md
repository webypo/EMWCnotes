## Introduction
This section is where I will be adding files that I'm using to experiment with layouts for webpages or blog posts to be used elsewhere.

### FiletypesFile types included in this section could include:
- [ ] HTML
- [ ] CSS
- [ ] .txt
- [ ] .doc
- [ ] .md
- [ ] _maybe_ some JavaScript _(I've barely started learning JS so initially JS will likely be rare)_

_(A checked box indicates the filetype exists in this section and is not a README file)_

## Side Notes
- These files may be full documents or simply a hodge podge of code snippets
