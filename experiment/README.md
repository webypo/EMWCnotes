## Introduction
This section is where I will be adding files that I'm using to experiment with layouts for webpages or blog posts to be used elsewhere.


## Folders

Links in this section are to folders containing layout experiments I'm working on that I may or may not use elsewhere.

### Website

[Experiment 1](EMWCnotes\EMWCnotes\experiment\exp1\README-exp1.md)

#### Common Resources
This section contains resources that will work universally work with and potentially be used with every experimental design or layout.  No CSS to change fonts, colors, or other things that would likely be different in every experimental design or layout will be found here, those items will be included within the folder for the experiment the customizations go with.  An Experiment will need to be linked to the resources in this folder in addition to the resources within the experiment folder with the link to the resources placed in first ahead of the custom resources linked within the experiment folder.

- [rsc](EMWCnotes\EMWCnotes\experiment\rsc\README.md)
  - **Note:** *rsc* in this context is short for *resource* and is used to help reduce the number of characters in a file path.


## Side Notes
- The files in this section may be full or partial files, or simply a hodge-podge of code snips I'm playing with
- Regarding the inclusion of JavaScript
  - _I've started using "Head First JavaScript Programing" [Available on Amazon.com](http://amzn.to/2CDsG9r) to help develope a foundation in vanilla JS, I would prefer to learn more before I attempt to use it in any of my projects, but overtime I hope to find ways to incorporate JS into my projects._
- The PHP files in the *rsc* folder contain code I found in a forum on FreeCodeCamp.com the code works how I need and expect it to, but I have no understanding of PHP as of 2019-Aug. I am using this code only until I learn enough JS to be able to write an alternative that runs client side instead of server side.
