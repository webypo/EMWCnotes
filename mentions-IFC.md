# Notes and Clippings that mention the Interfaith Chapel

## Intro
This page will containe notes and clippings I find that mention the Interfaith Chapel either briefly or extensively.  I will try to organize them so they make sense to others, but I'm viewing this file as more of a scratchpad where I can put things I read where I read it, and if I have any thoughts about what I read, the inclusion of those thoughts.  So, the organizational structure may be a bit random looking, but I will be making adjustments and such to the order of things over time as I find more information, but yes, it will likely look like a disaster to anyone other than me, but this is the way I process things and it seems to work for me.

    Cultural and Religion Sensitivity:

        In addition to the four categories of programs provided to the people we serve,
        all individuals have the right to worship and practice their religious beliefs 
        at the hospital. Chaplains from the Protestant and Catholic faiths, a Jewish Rabbi,
        and an Imam are available to assist individuals in practicing their respective 
        religions. In addition, individuals have ready-access to pastoral counseling. 
        For individuals whose faith/religion is outside the traditional denominations, 
        the hospital's Culturally Appropriate Treatment and Services Committee works with
        the individual and his or her treatment team to ensure that the person's religious
        needs are met.
