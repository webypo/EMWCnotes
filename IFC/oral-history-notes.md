# Oral History Notes

## File purpose
This file contains notes on the unconfirmed oral history of the Interfaith chapel at WSH. My reason for these notes is to give me someplace to jot down things I remeber hearing, over the years regarding the Interfaith Chapel, but do not have any type of paper trail to either confirm or deny the accurracy of the oral history.

## Keep in mind:
This information is not confirmed, and should not be treated as fact, I do not have any documentation to back the informatin in this file. As unconfirmed information it is simply being used by me as a source of possible leads as I research the connection between the Intrefaith Chapel and Trinity Memorial.  If I am able to confirm something in this document, I will remove it from this file and move it to a file created for confirmed items and the source(s) of the confirmation.

*_Names will not be included, just initials and if applicable the person's title due to the public nature of this document and my lack of signed waivers allowing me to publicize people's names_*
