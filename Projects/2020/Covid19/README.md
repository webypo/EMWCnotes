## Intro

This is my attempt at trying to document some of what I've observed, or experienced as Sars-CoV-2 (Covid-19) turned the world upside down overnight.  My main focus will be on the impact Covid-19 has had on Diapers and Such(DAS), but I will also include other things happening outside of DAS to aid with context.

My hope is that my documenting of a small part of what has happened during the Covid-19 pandemic might be of use to others in the future who may be studying the pandemic and maybe want to get a glimpse into what life was like as it unfolded.
