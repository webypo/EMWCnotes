## Intro

This is the day when I began to wake-up to Covid-19 and start to realize it wasn't just a problem in Wuhan Province, China, or Washington, USA... it was making its way towards my community.

This particular Wednesday, really felt like any other Wednesday in my recent years, as did the evening service. The "awakening", for me, began during the Lenten class following the service and I'll offer more detail below.

### A Typical Day

***Weds., March 11, 2020,***

It was in every way a typical day, at Trinity Memorial.

I was there for the Diapers & Such distribution day; A volunteer helped repackage diapers for future distribution, while I prepared for 2 fundraisers. Fr. Matthew, was in and out of the building, which is typical him. Office volunteers were busy in the office, which is also pretty standard.  I did notice a slight increase in the number of volunteers and people in leadership roles within the church coming and going, but assumed the increase was pre-Easter activity, which also is typical. The evening service was also pretty typical. Nothing seemed unusual the entire day until the Lenten class.

### Lenten Class

***Before Class***

It was in the short time between the service leading up to the class when I began noticing some unusual activity.

Fr. Matthew was speaking with those present who are in other leadership roles, many conversations seemed to be held in hushed tones and there was a sense of uneasy urgency in the air which is very different from what is typically seen after a Wednesday service when there is a class of any sort happening.

Even with these observations, I still didn't realize what was happening, since I was still thinking Covid-19 was "someplace else". In my case, I wasn't in denial that Covid-19 existed, I just didn't realize how quickly it was spreading; As the old adage indicates, 'ignorance is bliss', and until after the class began, I was ignorant of what was happening and as such, unbothered by it.

***During Class***

*The Email*  
Fr. Matthew Scott, opened with prayer, and then gave the handful of folks present an overview of an email _[[1](#sources#1)]_ he had received from Bishop Sean Rowe, DioNWPA&WNY.
