## Intro

This is the day when I began to wake-up to Covid-19 and start to realize it wasn't just a problem in Wuhan Province, China, or Washington, USA... it was making its way towards my community.

This particular Wednesday, really felt like any other Wednesday in my recent years, as did the evening service. The "awakening", for me, began during the Lenten class following the service and I'll offer more detail below.

## A Typical Day

**Day 1:** *Weds., March 11, 2020*

In every way it a typical Wednesday, at Trinity Memorial.

I was there for the Diapers & Such ( [See DAS](Projects\2020\Covid-19\TMC-C19\das\README.md) ) distribution day; A volunteer had helped with repackaging diapers for future distribution, as I prepared for two fundraisers.  Fr. Matthew Scott, our Vicar, was in and out of the building, which is pretty typical for him. Office volunteers were busy in the office, this too was pretty standard.  I did notice a slight increase in the number of volunteers and people in leadership roles within the church coming and going, but assumed the increase was pre-Easter activity, which based on past years seemed to fit so, I didn't think a whole lot about the extra people running about the building. The evening service wasn't any different than any other pervious service. Really, there was nothing that seemed unusual or different, until the Lenten class that followed the evening service, that was when things started to become noticably different.  Most things were subtle to where I doubt anyone attending for their first time ever would really have noticed them, but others, well they stood out a bit more.

## Lenten Class

### Before Class

It was in the short time between the service leading up to the class when I began noticing some unusual activity.

Fr. Matthew was speaking with those present who are in other leadership roles, many conversations seemed to be held in hushed tones and there was a sense of uneasy urgency in the air which is very different from what is typically seen after a Wednesday service when there is a class of any sort happening.

Even with these observations, I still didn't realize what was happening, since I was still thinking Covid-19 was "someplace else". In my case, I wasn't in denial that Covid-19 existed, I just didn't realize how quickly it was spreading; As the old adage indicates, 'ignorance is bliss', and until after the class began, I was ignorant of what was happening and as such, unbothered by it.


### During Class

*The Email*  
Fr. Matthew Scott, opened with prayer, and then gave the handful of folks present an overview of an email _[[A](#sources#a)]_ he had received from Bishop Sean Rowe, DioNWPA & WNY.  The email spoke of changes that Bishop Sean was recommending to prevent the spread of Covid-19. Some suggestions included not passing the offering plate, but rather placing it in a set location so people could drop their offering in the plate as they walked by to take their seat.  Intinction (dipping the wafer into the chalice) during communion was to stop, hand sanitizer was to be placed where the Clergy, Acolytes and Chalice Bearers could access it and use it before handling the various vessels or the bread and wine. I don't think there was anything on the list that we hadn't already implemented. Everyone was quiet the rest of the class, and most were visibly worried or concerned.  I don't think any of us fully grasped what was coming, but at that point, services were to continue with the changes in place, and ministries and groups would continue to utilize the building though disinfecting surfaces was to be added to every ministry or group's to-do list.
