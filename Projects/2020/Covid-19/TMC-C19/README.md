## Intro

Trinity Memorial Church is located in Warren, Warren County, PA and was founded in 1865.  This isn't the first Pandemic our church has seen, it's just the first that any of our members has experienced firsthand.

This an other related files are based on my personal observations and experiences during the Covid-19 Pandemic.  I will share my experiences starting with Wednesday, March 11, 2020, because that was my initial wakeup call to that told me covid-19 was a bigger problem than I had initially thought it to be, but even on that day, I had no idea what would happen in the following days and weeks.

My goal is to only document a small portion of the pandemic based on what I've observed and how I experienced it.  My focus is predominantly on Trinity Memorial since it is what I am most familiar with.
