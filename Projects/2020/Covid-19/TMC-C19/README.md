## Intro

Trinity Memorial Church was founded in 1865, and is located in the City of Warren, Warren County, PA, USA. This isn't the first Pandemic our church has seen, it's just the first pandemic of this size that any of our members have experienced firsthand.

This an other related files are based on my personal observations and experiences during the Covid-19 Pandemic.

I will share my experiences starting with Wednesday, March 11, 2020, because that was my initial wakeup call to that told me covid-19 was a bigger problem than I had initially thought it to be, but even then, I had no idea what would happen in the following days and weeks.

My goal is to only document a small portion of the pandemic based on what I've observed and how I experienced it. My focus is predominantly on Trinity Memorial since it is what I am most familiar with, but for context, I may include information pertaining to my local community, the COmmonwealth of Pennsylvania, the United States, and possibly even mentions of what was happening worldwide.

The Covid-19 pandemic caused drastic changes worldwide, but as I said, my focus is on Trinity Memorial Episcopal Church and my local community.
