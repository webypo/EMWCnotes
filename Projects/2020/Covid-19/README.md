## Intro

This is not about the covid-19 pandemic as a whole, but rather this section only pertains to the impact that Covid-19 has had on the Episcopal Mission of Warren County(EMWC).

### My goal

As of April 4, 2020 my goal is simply to do what I can to document the impact of the covid-19 pandemic on EMWC (including Trinity and St. Francis) and in addition to Warren County, PA and to some degree include the info from the State and Federal governments to aid with context.

I will not claim that what I produce will be complete coverage since odds are really good that I will miss things as I try to document this history based on the small portion of it from my where I am at as I witness, observe and experience the Covid-19 pandemic.


# Impact

***Note:*** *I will link to subsections as I create them*

- EMWC
  - Trinity Memorial Episcopal Church in Warren, PA
  - St. Francis of Assisi in Youngsville, PA
