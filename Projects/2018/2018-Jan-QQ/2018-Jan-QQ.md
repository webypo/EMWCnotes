## Topic Ideas

  - Rev C.C. Parker
  - Rev. W.H. Jones
  - Rev. E. Pinkney Wroth
  - Rev. Keyes II


## What do I know about these ideas

- Rev. C.C. Parker
    - First Rector of Trinity
    - Also the rector in Corry at the same time as TMC
    - Lived in Warren
    - Was involved in the construction of "The Little Red Church"
    - Both praised and admonished for his work regarding the construction of Trinity
        - May have neglected to include a heating system in the building when it was
            first built which caused huge amounts of friction between him and the congregation.
        - other indications though seem to say that he was determined to overcome every
            obstacle that was faced
        - could it be that people eiether loved him or hated him and there was little or
            room between the two camps?

- Rev. W.H. Jones
    - Chaplain with Ohio Artillary during one of the world wars
    - Rector at Trinity
    - Was called to Activ duty during his time at TMC
    - Rumored to have come back from serving in the military in 'bad shape' uncleaer on specifics

- Rev. E. Pinkney Wroth [Sr.]
    - Rector at Trinity
    - Left Trinity to Become Bishop of the Diocese of Erie
        - Died soon after having a heart attack while playing tennis.
    - Active in the community
        - Have seen mention of various speaking engagements including but not limited to praying before political events.
    - Had a son named Edward Pinkney Wroth, Jr.
    - Oral history passed on to me by a third-party indicates that someone she took cared of
        needed help building a barn, and that Rev. Pinkney Wroth assisted with the construction
        of it. This to me indicates that Rev. Pinkney Wroth wasn't afraid to get his hands dirty
        and possibly even to say that if he saw a need he would do what he could to help meet that
        need.

- Rev. Keyes II
    - I only know that he was the Rector at TMC between either Wroth And Rutledge or Rutledge and Baker
    - Would like to learn more about his time at Trinity, but have no leads to get me started beyond that he was the Rector.
