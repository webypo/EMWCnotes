## Introduction
My primary interest is in the role that Trinity Memorial Church (Warren, PA) in part or in whole played in helping with the process involved in building the Inter-faith Chapel at Warren State Hospital.  Any information outside of this interest is added for context in an attempt at creating a more complete overview of the histroy of the Inter-faith Chapel at Warren State Hospital
