## Introduction
This section is where I will be adding files that I'm using to experiment with layouts for webpages or blog posts to be used elsewhere.

### Filetypes
File types included in this section could include:
- [ ] HTML
- [ ] CSS
- [ ] .txt
- [ ] .doc
- [ ] .md
- [ ] JavaScript _Big Maybe_

_(A checked box indicates the filetype exists in this section and is not a README file)_

## Side Notes
- The files in this section may be full or partial files, or simply a hodge podge of code snippets I'm playing with
- Regarding the inclusion of JavaScript
    - _I've started using "Head First JavaScript Programing" [Available on Amazon.com](http://amzn.to/2CDsG9r) to help develope a foundation in vanilla JS, I would prefer to learn more before I attempt to use it in any of my projects, but overtime I hope to find ways to incorporate JS into my projects._
